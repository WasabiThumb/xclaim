## Installation
You can download a build from the [releases tab](https://github.com/WasabiThumb/xclaim/releases) on the right, or [build the plugin yourself](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html#build-the-project) if you want. Then, place the JAR into your plugins folder. Don't use the JAR labelled "original" unless you know what you are doing.

## Features
The main command is /xclaim (alias /xc). This allows players to create and manage their claims. Claims have several permissions that can be toggled, either by general groups (nobody, trusted players, veteran players, all players) or by individuals. The GUI also allows players to add/remove players from their trusted list.

### Map Integration
- Map integration should work out-of-the-box as long as it is [configured properly](#config). If it does not, please create an Issue on the [Issues page](https://github.com/WasabiThumb/xclaim/issues).
- BlueMap integration has also been supported since version 1.10.0.

### Importing from ClaimChunk
This process should be done without any players online. The server should have ClaimChunk AND XClaim loaded at the same time. It's possible that you need PlaceholderAPI on the server as well while doing this, but you definitely don't need either ClaimChunk nor PlaceholderAPI for XClaim to work normally. Once all of those conditions are met, run /importclaims. This may take a while or be resource intensive since it will attempt to turn adjacent claimed chunks into one group.

### Languages
As of version 1.6.x, multiple languages are supported. When the plugin starts, default language packs are loaded into ``/plugins/XClaim/lang``. Below are a list of default language packs:
- en-US (American English)
- de (German) by eingruenesbeb
- zh (Simplified Chinese) by SnowCutieOwO

The plugin decides what language to use based on the "language" option in the [config](#config).
\
\
If you want to make your own language pack, copy an existing one as an example (e.g. ``/plugins/XClaim/lang/en-US.json``) and rename it [accordingly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (e.g. ``fr.json``). You can then translate the contents of that file. Knowledge of [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Syntax) and [MiniMessage](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/index.html) is highly suggested. Do not translate the keys, only the values. Language packs may become less human-readable after encoding, so it is suggested to get your language pack base from [the source](https://github.com/WasabiThumb/xclaim/tree/master/src/main/resources/lang). There are some cases where the symbols ``$1``, ``$2``, etc. are used. This means that "something is inserted here", for example ``Hello $1!`` may resolve to ``Hello Username!`` ingame.

### Economy
By default, economy features are disabled. To enable them, set "use-economy" in the config to true.\
If use-economy is enabled, XClaim will attempt to hook into the following economy plugins if present:
- Vault
- EssentialsX

Players will then pay depending on the permission group the player is in (see [here](#permissions)).\
For instance, if you wanted to set the default price for a claim to 2.25, then you would set ``limits.default.claim-price`` to ``2.25``.\
See all options in the [config section](#config).

## Config

| use-economy | Whether to use economy features | false |
| limits.𝘨𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘱-𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘦.max-chunks | Sets the max chunks for a group. See Permissions for more info. | |
